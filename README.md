Welcome! I'm a results-oriented **Data Engineer and Data Scientist** with 5+ years‚Äô experience building cloud-native data and machine learning pipelines across **Azure**, **AWS**, and **GCP**.

I design and deploy scalable **Python-based RESTful APIs**, real-time ETL frameworks, and **LLM-integrated automation tools**. From unstructured text and financial records to industrial sensor data, I specialise in transforming complex data into clean, actionable insights that fuel dashboards, reports, and smart applications.

At **10Alytics**, I lead dual-role delivery‚Äîmerging engineering rigour with statistical modelling and GenAI to serve energy, finance, and BI clients across the UK and beyond.
