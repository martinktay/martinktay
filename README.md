## 🎯 About Me
I’m a results-oriented **Data Engineer & Data Scientist** with 5+ years’ experience building cloud-native data and ML pipelines across Azure, AWS & GCP. I thrive on turning complex datasets into clear, compelling stories that drive real-world impact—whether that’s forecasting customer lifetime value, reducing churn, or surfacing player behavior insights in subscription gaming. I design and deploy scalable Python-based APIs, real-time ETL frameworks, and LLM-driven automation tools that empower teams to make data-driven decisions.
